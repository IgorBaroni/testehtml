You seem to replace
Your brain with your heart
You take things so hard
And then you fall apart
You try to explain
But before you can start
Those cry baby tears
Come out of the dark
Someone's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
They're pouring out
Where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
It's why you won't fit inside
They're pouring out
Where everyone can see
They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
'Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You just let them drop
You just let them drop
Cry baby, cry baby
You're all on your own and
You lost all your friends
You told yourself that
It's not you, it's them
You're one of a kind
And no oneâ€¦
